NAME
    HTML::FormFu::Filter::Demoroniser - Filter Microsoft "smart" characters

SYNOPSIS
        ---
        elements:
          - type: Text
            name: foo
            filters:
              - type: Demoroniser

DESCRIPTION
    As a user fills out a form, they may copy and paste data from Micrsoft
    Word. In doing so, they might inadvertently copy Microsoft "smart"
    characters (fancy quotation marks, for example) into the field.

    This module aims to help clean up that data in favor of UTF8 or ASCII
    alternatives.

METHODS
  filter( $value )
    Filters $value through Text::Demoronise. By default it will use
    "demoroniser_utf8", though if you specify any text other than "utf8" in
    the "encoding" option, it will convert problem characters to an ASCII
    alternative.
